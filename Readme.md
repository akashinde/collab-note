## 🧐 About <a name = "about"></a>
Purpose of this project is to understand the working of WebSocket protocol. It enables the long-lived communication between clients (such as browsers) and servers. It allows data to be transmitted between clients and servers in real-time without being need to constantly request from client. In this project, we will be using Twilio Sync API which is a way to synchronize real-time data between client and server. It uses WebSocket protocol to establish a persistent and bidirectional communication between clients and servers. To demonstrate, we will create a note application and implement the WebSocket protocol using Twilio Sync API so that multiple clients can collaborate on a single note in real-time.
